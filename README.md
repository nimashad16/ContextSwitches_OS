How I ran the project:










Bugs that I expected:
Some of the bugs that I expected was about figuring out how to get the proper location of the integers I needed in the array.
Another expected bug that I encountered was having the correct math behind each time. On some of the times I failed to understand the mathematics behind them and even how to calculate them. Some of these issues that I expected I definitely ran across during my program. One of the main ones I ran into however was getting the proper inputs for the array and being able to store the burst integers into their own array. This gave me problems because it determined the rest of the calculations.
